ADDED: `collapseRHSNoops` inlining stage and `WorkIdentity` constructor.

It is now possible to define primitives to be identical to one of their arguments via the newly introduced `WorkIdentity` constructor.
This constructor effectivly marks a primitve to be a noop, which further can be conditioned upon multiple of its arguments being noops themselves.
For an example see `Clash.Sized.Vector.map`.

There is a new inlining stage `collapseRHSNoops` which runs just before `inlineCleanup`.
It will find noop-primitives defined in such way and `unsafeCoerce#` them to their identity argument.

The goal of all of this is to prevent redundant HDL output. (See Issue #779)
